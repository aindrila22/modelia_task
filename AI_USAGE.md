- **ImageUpload.tsx**: AI assisted with drag-and-drop functionality and image downscaling logic
- **GenerateButton.tsx**: AI helped implement retry logic with exponential backoff
- **EmptyState.tsx**: AI suggested reusable empty state component design

### **Testing Implementation**
- **Unit Tests**: AI generated test cases for component behavior, user interactions, and edge cases
- **E2E Tests**: AI helped structure Playwright tests for critical user flows
- **Test Configuration**: AI assisted with Jest and Playwright configuration setup

### **Performance Optimizations**
- **Code Splitting**: AI suggested lazy loading strategy for better bundle optimization
- **Memoization**: AI recommended React.memo usage for expensive components
- **Image Optimization**: AI helped implement client-side image downscaling

### **Error Handling & UX**
- **Error Boundaries**: AI helped design comprehensive error handling strategy
- **Loading States**: AI suggested Suspense fallback components
- **User Feedback**: AI helped implement retry mechanisms and user notifications

## Development Workflow

### **AI-Assisted Development Process**
